This is determined from a Poisson probability distribution model.
    It means that we can accurately predict the number of arrivals, since none affect the chance the others have of happening.<br />A single server queue will process each customer one-by-one on a first come, first served basis. When the service is complete
    the customer leaves the queue and the number of customers in the system reduces by one.<br />This is done at a mean rate of μ.<br />Here the buffer that holds the arrivals in waiting is of infinite size, so there is no limit on the number of customers
    it can contain. This would not be possible in a practical scenario, however.<br /></p></div>

                    <h2 class="text-center">What Is A Queue Network?<br></h2><p>A queueing network is simply several single server queues chained together with a logical network <a href="#2">[2]</a>. This could be visualised as different desks in a bank. A customer can pick one of them to wait in line for, and they work together to help everyone
    that requires assistance. There are many different arrangements of the desks and the way in which customers are divided among them and each such arrangement of queues forms a network.<br />The one we will be focusing on is a layered queue network.
    In such an arrangement, a component can be modelled as both client and server. This fact stems from the way a layered queuing network manages and completes requests. Each one is executed through a series of further requests to both other servers and
    for services to the host. This nesting element, of queuing at other servers, is where the core of a layered queue network lies. This is especially important for microservices, because a microservice can serve a client request as well as a service
    request from another microservice <a href="#3">[3]</a>.<br /></p></div>

                    <h2 class="text-center">How Does This Help?<br></h2>
                    <p>Using this kind of analytical modelling approach, we can better decide how and when to distribute resources to the servers. The state of the queue network can be examined and, based on the results, resources can either be added vertically
                        (increasing the capacity of existing hardware of software) or horizontally (adding more hardware or software).<br>Let’s try to apply the commonly found rules-based approach, outlined above, to our view of the servers as a queue
                        network. We could imagine a situation where, if a certain queue’s waiting area is above a threshold value and the machine handling it is at a high utilisation, then resources might be allocated horizontally. This would allow the
                        backlog of jobs in the waiting area to be processed more quickly, while also accommodating the possibility of a traffic surge – which will be more likely to occur with a general increase in traffic.&nbsp;<br>But would this truly
                        be adaptable enough? As mentioned before, this is the traditional approach that is currently used, and it has a major weakness. It might seem that the system will be able to handle traffic surges, but we should keep in mind that
                        resources are added linearly, “as the need arises”. If, however, for a certain workload a very large increase in processing power is required, by<br>the time this approach reaches a stable situation, many of the users might have
                        timed out and many of the requests might have been<br>fulfilled so having all those resources is now redundant.<br>Instead, we can use mathematical models and queue theory for better results. Utilizing analytical models will be
                        much faster than machine learning and, as a result, we can analyse multiple resource allocation patterns. The system will take into account the total amount of resources and the different effects of horizontal and vertical resource
                        allocation for particular traffic surges. It will thus be<br>capable to make accurate decisions not only about the amount of resources required, but also about the way in which they should be<br>allocated. Taking this approach
                        will prove to have considerable benefits, allowing us, after the above have been calculated, to pick<br>out the best resource allocation pattern and use it as the scaling configuration. <br></p>
