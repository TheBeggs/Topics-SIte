                    <h2 class="text-center">Where To Find Them?<br></h2><p class="text-left">A &quot;Microservice&quot; is a reasonably new term in the world of software architecture, and is yet to have a universal definition. However, this does not mean that it has a niche market. Many famous brands you may have heard of, use them in their
    products, such as Netflix, Amazon, Twitter, Spotify, Soundcloud, Uber, and the list goes on. Although there is not an exact way to define them, microservices generally share a set of common characteristics <a href="#1">[1]</a>.<br /><br /></p></div>

                    <h2 class="text-center">A More Flexible Approach<br></h2>
                    <p class="text-left">Before delving deeper, we should familiarize ourselves with the idea of the “back end” of an application. This term describes the “behind the scenes” of the web applications we use. The part that we see is a user interface; it makes
                        requests to the server for certain data to be retrieved or for particular tasks to be completed. These tasks are<br>performed on a server, where the bulk of the application is stored and run. The server can both store and receive
                        data from a database. Originally, and still in use today, is when web applications are run as a monolithic application (monolith coming from the Greek 'monos' – 'single' and 'lithos' – 'stone'), The name defines an application
                        which comes as one tightly coupled set of functionalities, all with the same database. Despite its widespread use, this architecture has its problems. One example is the failure of a specific part,&nbsp;interconnected with the
                        rest, which requires taking the entire application down in order to fix, and then put back online. However, microservices do not suffer from many of the problems that affect monolithic architecture and can be used instead to avoid
                        such issues.<br><br></p>

                    <h2 class="text-center">Why Are They Popular With DevOps?<br></h2>
                    <p class="text-left">Microservices are becoming an important part of DevOps due to their common interests and implementations. Such an example is continuous integration, as microservices keep services separate, more and more services and functionality
                        can be integrated into the system without affecting the system. Another DevOps interest that microservices helps to implement is advanced monitoring. This implementation can be seen due to the ease of tracking issues with a system
                        down to a microservice, which can then be independently resolved. <br></p>

                    <h2 class="text-center">How Do They Work?<br></h2>
                    <p class="text-left">Instead of one large application, tightly coupled together and reliant on the perfect functionality of every part, utilizing one central database, they represent many loosely coupled services (or microservices, as they are called).
                        Each has its own storage and only communicates with the other services through an asynchronous lightweight messaging system or an HTTP request/response API. This is called componentization, where each microservice is an individual
                        component (we define a component as a piece of software that can be replaced or upgraded independently of the rest of the software). This solves the issue of having to take down the entire application for a bug affecting a single
                        functionality. Microservices are therefore considered quite fine-grained, whereas web services would be considered coarse-grained. The granularity of a system is how large each its components are, with coarse meaning larger, and
                        fine meaning smaller.<br><br></p>

                    <h2 class="text-center">What Other Advantages Are There Over Classic Web services?<br></h2>
                    <p class="text-left">An important aspect is that each microservice team is able to focus on a specific service to provide the end user, from storage to server-side code, to user interface. This means that the architecture is more business oriented, as
                        it makes it easier to create and maintain different services for users, with little to no effect on the other functionalities provided. Moreover, as each microservice has its own&nbsp;user interface, server-side code, and storage
                        system, there can be a&nbsp;separate set of standards governing each one and they can even be&nbsp;written in different languages.&nbsp;Furthermore, it means that each&nbsp;microservice can use an appropriate storage system for
                        the service it&nbsp;provides. It may be appropriate to have a relational database for one&nbsp;microservice, but a generic file storage system might be a better&nbsp;choice for another. This is an advantage over the monolithic&nbsp;architecture
                        which only has one unified storage system. &nbsp;The&nbsp;separation of microservices also has the benefit that whenever the&nbsp;application is in high demand, the appropriate services can be scaled&nbsp;up to the meet it, which
                        is much more efficient than the approach for&nbsp;monolithic applications.<br><br></p>
